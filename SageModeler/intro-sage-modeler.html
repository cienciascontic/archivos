        <h3>Make a diagram</h3>

<p>Consider what you want to model. Perhaps you’re thinking about the factors involved in climate change or variables that affect water quality in your local river. Want to diagram your understanding of a predator-prey relationship?</p>

<p>What images do you want to include in your model? (Hint: If it’s something very abstract, use the blue box icon.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the “New Image” icon in the upper left of the SageModeler tool or drag the icon onto the canvas. </li> 
<li>Search for an image using the <strong>Image Search</strong> (which searches for public domain images on openclipart.org).</li> 
<li>Once you’ve located an image, click <strong>Add Image</strong> to add it your palette. </li> 
<li>Search for additional images or close the “Add New Image” box. </li> 
<li>Now drag the image from the palette to the canvas.</li> 
</ol>
<h3>Add connections</h3>
<p>After you’ve added images to your canvas, connect them with links to show which variable affects the other. Select an image, click the arrow, and drag it to another image, then release. </p><p>

<h3>Create relationships </h3>
<p>You’ve added images and links – great! Now, define relationships by clicking a variable (image), then the arrow icon (relationship inspector) in the inspector palette. For instance, what do you think would happen to the Earth’s temperature if greenhouse gases increase? Or what would happen to water quality if there’s an increase in phosphates?</p>

<h3>Simulate your model</h3>

<p>After you’ve set all the relationships, it’s time to run your model and collect data. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click the Simulate arrow in the upper right of the window, which will start simulation of the model and expand to display data recording options. You can now adjust model variables by changing their slider handles.</p><img src="slider-handles.png" alt="Slider handles" style="height: auto; width: 320px;"> </li>
<li><p>You can show mini-graphs of those changes by clicking the gear icon and turning them on in the simulation settings. </p><img src="gear-icon-selected.png" alt="Show mini-graphs" style="height: auto; width: 320px;"><p>
<img src="mini-graphs.png" alt="Mini-graphs" style="height: auto; width: 320px;"></p></li>
<li><p>You can record one data point or record a data stream, which allows you to record all of the variables as you make changes in real time. It is recommended to increment the experiment counter each time you explore the impact of a new variable.

<li><p>Add  a <strong>graph</strong> by clicking the icon in the upper left panel.
</p>
<li><p><strong>Configure the graph</strong> by dragging table headers to the graph axes or click in he graph axes to set variables.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Explore your data</h3>

<p>Because SageModeler is embedded in CODAP, you can explore data with tables, graphs, and more. Check out the <a href="http://codap.concord.org/help/" target="_blank" title="CODAP Help Videos">CODAP help videos</a>.</p>   </div></body>
